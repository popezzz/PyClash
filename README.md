# PyClash
Boxing League clash simulator made in python.

## Why did you make this?
I just felt like it lol. Didn't take me much time anyway.

## Can I use this?
__ONLY IF YOU GIVE ME A SLICE OF PIZZA.__

On a serious note, yes you can. Please __READ THE LICENSE.__

## What are the requirements?
Just have python installed I guess. lol

## How do I use this?
This program is originally intended to run in a virtual environment. To do this
you should run the following commands:

``` bash
cd src
python3 -m venv yourVenvFolderName
mv main.py menuPage.py requirements.txt yourVenvFolderName
cd yourVenvFolderName
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you feel like you don't need to use a virtual environment (most likely since you
use Windows), you can use pip install -r requirements.txt right away.

Finally, you can run your program!

``` bash
python3 main.py
```
