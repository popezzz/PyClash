# PyClash
Boxing League clash simulator made in python.

## Why did you make this?
I just felt like it lol. Didn't take me much time anyway.



_Note: It actually did take me some time_

## Can I use this?
__ONLY IF YOU GIVE ME A SLICE OF PIZZA.__




On a serious note, yes you can. _Only if you feel like it._

Please [__READ THE LICENSE.__](LICENSE) ***Especially if you wanna use this.***

## What are the requirements?
Just have python installed I guess. lol



__YOU'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO GIVE ME 10 BUCKS. I HAVE TO RETIRE MY PARENTS.__ (_I'm joking_)

## How do I use this?
This program is originally intended to run in a virtual environment. To do this
you should run the following commands:

``` bash
cd src
python3 -m venv yourVenvFolderName
cp main.py menuPage.py requirements.txt yourVenvFolderName
cd yourVenvFolderName
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you feel like you don't need to use a virtual environment (most likely since you
use Windows), you can use __pip install -r requirements.txt__ right away.

Finally, you can run your program!

``` bash
python3 main.py
```

## Add a quote at the end of the README?
Sure, why not.
